  message: |
    The `HttpOnly` attribute when set to `true` protects the cookie value from being accessed by
    client side JavaScript such
    as reading the `document.cookie` values. By enabling this protection, a website that is
    vulnerable to
    Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) will be able to block malicious scripts from accessing the cookie
    value from JavaScript.

    Example of protecting an HttpCookie:
    ```
    // Create an HttpOnly cookie.
    HttpCookie someCookie = new HttpCookie("SomeCookieName", "SomeValue");
    someCookie.HttpOnly = true;
    ```
