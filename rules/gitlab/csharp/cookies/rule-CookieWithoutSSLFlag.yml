  message: |
    The `Secure` attribute when set to `true` protects the cookie value from being being
    transmitted over clear text
    communication paths such as HTTP. By enabling this protection, the cookie will only be sent
    over HTTPS.

    Example of protecting an HttpCookie:
    ```
    // Create an HttpOnly cookie.
    HttpCookie someCookie = new HttpCookie("SomeCookieName", "SomeValue");
    someCookie.Secure = true;
    ```

    Session cookies should be configured with the following security directives:

    - [HTTPOnly](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#restrict_access_to_cookies)
    - [SameSite](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite)
    - [Secure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#restrict_access_to_cookies)
