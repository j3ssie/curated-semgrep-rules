  message: |
    The `ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback` event has been set
    to always return `true`, which effectively disables the validation of server
    certificates.

    This allows for an adversary who is in between the application and the target host to intercept
    potentially sensitive information or transmit malicious data.

    Remove the callback function that is returning true to allow normal certificate validation to
    proceed.
    When no callback is provided, the client will validate that the certificate name matches the
    hostname
    that was used when creating the request.
