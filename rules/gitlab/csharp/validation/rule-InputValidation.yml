  message: |
    By using the `[ValidateInput(false)]` attribute in a controller
    class, the application will disable request validation for that
    method. This disables ASP.NET from examining requests for injection
    attacks such as Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS).

    If possible, re-enable validation by using `ValidateInput(true)`.
    In some cases this may not be possible, in which case ensure how the
    request data used is validated and this method does not
    output user input directly into the view.

    For more information on protecting ASP.NET Core applications from XSS see:
    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/cross-site-scripting

    Example of enabling `ValidateInput` attribute:
    ```
    class ControllerClass
    {
        [ValidateInput(true)]
        public void SomeActionMethod()
        {
        }
    }
    ```
