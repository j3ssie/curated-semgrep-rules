  message: |
    Usage of the `chown` function call hints at a potential Time Of Check Time Of Use (TOCTOU)
    vulnerability. An attacker may be able to modify the file being specified by the `chmod`
    function prior to the `chown` function being called. Since `chown` will resolve symbolic links,
    an attacker may be able to exploit this fact to have files outside of their control modified.

    It is recommended that the `fchown` or the `lchown` functions be used instead. The `fchown`
    function takes a file descriptor instead of a file. The `lchown` function does not follow
    symbolic links. Ensure the opened file descriptor is pointing to the correct file or
    directory prior to executing `fchown` or any other file based operations.
