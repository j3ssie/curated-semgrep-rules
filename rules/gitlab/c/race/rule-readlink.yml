  message: |
    Usage of the `readlink` function call hints at a potential Time Of Check Time Of Use (TOCTOU)
    vulnerability. An attacker may be able to modify the file being specified by the `readlink`
    function prior to the `readlink` function being called. Additionally, care must be taken
    that the buffer provided is large enough to hold the contents of the file.

    Instead of using `readlink`, use `lstat` prior to opening the file and confirm the attributes
    are correct. Then use `open` to get a file descriptor to this file. Call `fstat` on the
    `open` file descriptor to confirm that `st_dev` and `st_ino` are equal between the two.
    If they are, it is safe to read and operate on the file's contents.
