  message: |
    Usage of the `chmod` function call hints at a potential Time Of Check Time Of Use (TOCTOU)
    vulnerability. An attacker may be able to modify the file being specified by the `chmod`
    function prior to the `chmod` function being called. Since `chmod` will resolve symbolic links,
    an attacker may be able to exploit this fact to have files outside of their control modified.

    It is recommended that the `fchmod` function be used instead since this function takes
    a file descriptor instead of a file. Ensure the opened file descriptor is pointing to
    the correct file or directory prior to executing `fchmod` or any other file based operations.
