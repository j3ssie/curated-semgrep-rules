  message: |
    Usage of the `access` function call hints at a potential Time Of Check Time Of Use (TOCTOU)
    vulnerability. Using the `access` function to check if a file exists and is readable before
    opening it, an attacker can create a race condition between the `access` call and
    opening the file. The attacker could replace the file with a different one or modify its
    content between the time the `access` function is called and the file is opened, thus
    bypassing the permission check.

    Call `setuid` to drop privileges on the process prior to opening any files. Instead of using
    `access`, use `lstat` prior to opening the file and confirm the attributes are correct. Then
    use `open` to get a file descriptor to this file. Call `fstat` on the `open` file descriptor
    to confirm that `st_dev` and `st_ino` are equal between the two. If they are, it is safe to
    read and operate on the file's contents.
