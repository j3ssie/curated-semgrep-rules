  message: |
    The `vfork` function is suffers from portability issues and is not recommended. In
    some Linux systems `vfork` is vulnerable to a race condition while the child process
    is running as the user's UID but hasn't executed `execve`. The user may be able to send
    signals to this process, which in `vfork` would not be sent to the parent process. As
    a result a user may be able to cause a denial of service against the privileged process.

    Use `fork` instead and be aware of other potential Time Of Check Time Of Use (TOCTOU)
    vulnerabilities.
