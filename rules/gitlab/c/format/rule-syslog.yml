  message: |
    Format string vulnerabilities allow an attacker to read or in some cases, potentially write
    data to
    and from locations in the processes' memory. To prevent against format string attacks, do not
    allow
    users or un-validated input to provide the format specification.
    Consider using a constant for the format specification, or strip all format
    specifiers from the input prior to calling the `syslog` function.
