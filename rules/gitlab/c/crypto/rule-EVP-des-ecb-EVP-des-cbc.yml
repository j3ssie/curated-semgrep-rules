  message: |
    The DES algorithm has not been recommended for over 15 years and was withdrawn from NIST (FIPS
    46-3) in 2005.

    Consider using libsodium's `crypto_secretbox_easy` authenticated encryption functions instead.

    For more information please see:
     https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/secret-key_cryptography/secretbox.

    If you must be FIPS compliant, consider using OpenSSLs AES or 3DES ciphers.
