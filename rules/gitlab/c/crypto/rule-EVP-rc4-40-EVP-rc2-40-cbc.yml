  message: |
    The RC4 algorithm is vulnerable to many attacks and should no longer be used for encrypting
    data streams.

    Consider using libsodium's `crypto_secretstream_xchacha20poly1305` stream cipher encryption
    functions instead. For more information please see:
    https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/secret-key_cryptography/secretstream

    If you must be FIPS compliant, consider using OpenSSLs AES or 3DES ciphers.
