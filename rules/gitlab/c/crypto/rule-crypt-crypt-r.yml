  message: |
    The crypt functions are not recommended due to the significantly small
    key space. Modern hardware can crack crypt produced passwords relatively quickly.

    Consider using the Argon2id password hashing algorithm provided by libsodium.
    For more information please see: https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/password_hashing.
