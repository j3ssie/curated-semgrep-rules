  message: |
    Some older Unix-like systems, `mkstemp` would create temp files with 0666 permissions,
    meaning the file created would be read/write access for all users.

    Ensure the process has called the `umask` function with restricted permissions prior
    to calling `mkstemp` and validate the permissions prior to using the file descriptor.

    For more information on temporary files please see:
