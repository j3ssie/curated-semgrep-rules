  message: |
    The `GetTempFileName` function works by generating a randomly named file, creating the file
    (if it does not exist) and then closing it. An application wishing to use this temporary file
    will need to reopen this file to begin working with it. This leads to a potential
    Time Of Check Time Of Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability, as an attacker could replace or modify
    the contents of the file prior to it being used by the application.

    Consider generating a random filename and opening the file directly in a single `CreateFile`
    or `OpenFile` call.
