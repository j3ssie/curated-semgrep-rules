  message: |
    There exists a possible race condition in between the time that `tempnam` or `tmpnam`
    returns a pathname, and the time that the program opens it, another program might create
    that pathname using `open`, or create it as a symbolic link.

    Consider using the `mkstemp` function instead, but be aware it also contains possible
    risks. Ensure the process has called the `umask` function with restricted permissions prior
    to calling `mkstemp` and validate the permissions prior to using the file descriptor.
