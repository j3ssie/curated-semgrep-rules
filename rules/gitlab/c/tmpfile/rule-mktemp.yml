  message: |
    The `mktemp` function should no longer be used due to multiple flaws. Some implementations
    created random files by using known information like the process ID and a single letter. This
    allows for possible race conditions where an attacker could guess or manipulate these files
    prior to them being used.

    Consider using the `mkstemp` function instead, but be aware it also contains possible
    risks. Ensure the process has called the `umask` function with restricted permissions prior
    to calling `mkstemp` and validate the permissions prior to using the file descriptor.
