  message: |
    Usage of the `open` family of functions may hint at a potential Time Of Check Time Of Use
    (TOCTOU)
    vulnerability. An attacker may be able to modify the file being specified by the `open`
    function prior to the `open` function being called.

    Prior to calling `open`, use `lstat` to open the file and confirm the attributes
    are correct. Then use `open` to get a file descriptor to this file. Call `fstat` on the
    `open` file descriptor to confirm that `st_dev` and `st_ino` are equal between the two.
    If they are, it is safe to read and operate on the file's contents.
