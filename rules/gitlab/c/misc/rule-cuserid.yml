  message: |
    `cuserid()` is poorly defined (e.g., some systems use the effective
    UID, like Linux, while others like System V use the real UID). Therefore, you can't trust
    what it does. The cuserid function was included in the 1988 version of POSIX, but removed
    from the 1990 version.  Also, if passed a non-null parameter, there's a risk of a buffer
    overflow if the passed-in buffer is not at least `L_cuserid` characters long.

    Use `getpwuid(geteuid())` and extract the desired information instead.

    For more information please see: https://linux.die.net/man/3/getpwuid
