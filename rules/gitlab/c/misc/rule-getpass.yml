  message: |
    This function is obsolete and not portable. It was in SUSv2 but removed by POSIX.2. What
    it does exactly varies considerably between systems, particularly in where its prompt is
    displayed and where it gets its data. Some systems will write to stderr instead of stdout.
    Some will read from stdin if it can not be read from /dev/tty. In some systems the
    buffer is static and limited to 127 characters, meaning the full password may not be returned
    properly.

    If you want to read input without terminal echoing enabled, see the description of the ECHO
    flag
    in the termios manual pager. If you ever read passwords from a terminal, be sure to zero the
    password as soon as possible, to avoid leaving the cleartext password visible in the
    process' address space.
