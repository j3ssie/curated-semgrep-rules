  message: |
    The `strlen` family of functions does not handle strings that are not null
    terminated. This can lead to buffer over reads and cause the application to
    crash by accessing unintended memory locations. It is recommended that `strnlen`
    be used instead as a `maxlen` value can be provided.

    For more information please see: https://linux.die.net/man/3/strnlen

    If developing for C Runtime Library (CRT), more secure versions of these functions should be
    used, see:
    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/strnlen-strnlen-s?view=msvc-170
