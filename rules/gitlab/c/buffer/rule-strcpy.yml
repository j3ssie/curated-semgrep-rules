  message: |
    The `strcpy` family of functions do not provide the ability to limit or check buffer
    sizes before copying to a destination buffer. This can lead to buffer overflows. Consider
    using more secure alternatives such as `strncpy` and provide the correct limit to the
    destination buffer and ensure the string is null terminated.

    For more information please see: https://linux.die.net/man/3/strncpy

    If developing for C Runtime Library (CRT), more secure versions of these functions should be
    used, see:
