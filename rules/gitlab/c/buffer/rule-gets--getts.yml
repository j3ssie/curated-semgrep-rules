  message: |
    The gets() function reads a line from stdin into the provided buffer
    until either a terminating newline or EOF. This terminating newline or
    EOF is replaced with a null byte `'\0'`. No check for buffer overruns are
    performed so it is recommended to use `fgets()` instead. Do note
    that some platforms will continue reading data after a `'\0'` is encountered.

    Usage of `fgets()` is not recommended for reading binary based files or inputs,
    instead the `read` or `fread` functions should be used.

    For more information please see: https://linux.die.net/man/3/fgets
