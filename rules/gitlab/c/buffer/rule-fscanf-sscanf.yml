  message: |
    Format specifiers can take optional field widths, which should be
    used to limit how many characters are copied into the target buffer.

    Example:
    ```
      const char str[20] = "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA";
      char buf[11] = {0};
      sscanf(str, "%10s", &buf); // buf = AAAAAAAAAA\0
    ```
