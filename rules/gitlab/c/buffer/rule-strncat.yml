  message: |
    The `strncat` family of functions are easy to use incorrectly when calculating destination
    buffer
    sizes. It is recommended to use more secure alternatives such as `snprintf`.

    For more information please see: https://linux.die.net/man/3/snprintf

    If developing for C Runtime Library (CRT), more secure versions of these functions should be
    used, see:
