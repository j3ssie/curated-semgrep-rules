  message: |
    The `lstrcpyn` family of functions do not always check for invalid pointers or check if there
    is sufficient space prior to copying. The count argument limits the number of characters copied
    but does validate if the count will fit within the size of the destination buffer, leading to
    potential overflows.

    If developing for C Runtime Library (CRT), more secure versions of these functions should be
    used, see:
