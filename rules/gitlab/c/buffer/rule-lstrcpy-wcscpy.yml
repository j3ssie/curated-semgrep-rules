  message: |
    The `lstrcpy` family of functions do not provide the ability to limit or check buffer
    sizes before copying to a destination buffer. This can lead to buffer overflows. Consider
    using more secure alternatives such as `strncpy_s`.

    If developing for C Runtime Library (CRT), more secure versions of these functions should be
    used, see:
