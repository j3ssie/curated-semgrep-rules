  message: |
    The `strcat` family of functions are unable to limit how many bytes are copied
    to the destination buffer. It is recommended to use more secure alternatives such as
    `snprintf`.

    For more information please see: https://linux.die.net/man/3/snprintf

    If developing for C Runtime Library (CRT), more secure versions of these functions should be
    used, see:
