  message: |
    Use sprintf_s, snprintf, or vsnprintf instead. The `sprintf` family of functions do not allow
    callers to set limits on how many bytes the destination buffer can hold. Consider using more
    secure alternatives such as `snprintf`.

    For more information please see: https://linux.die.net/man/3/snprintf

    If developing for C Runtime Library (CRT), more secure versions of these functions should be
    used, see:
