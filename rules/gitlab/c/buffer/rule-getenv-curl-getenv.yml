    This function's return value should be treated as untrusted input as it could be
    modified by an attacker. Possible risks include:

    - The value being too large and causing buffer overflows
    - Files under the attacker's control being used maliciously
    - Files outside of an attacker's control becoming accessible, depending on
    access privileges.
