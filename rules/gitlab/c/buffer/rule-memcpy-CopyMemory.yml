  message: |
    The `memcpy` family of functions require the developer to validate that the destination buffer
    is the same size or larger than the source buffer. Buffer overflows could be introduced if care
    is not taken to validate buffer sizes.

    If developing for C Runtime Library (CRT), more secure versions of these functions should be
    used, see:
