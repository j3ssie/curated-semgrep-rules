    It is generally not recommended to call out to the operating system to execute commands.
    When the application is executing file system based commands, user input should never be used
    in
    constructing commands or command arguments. If possible, determine if a library can be used
    instead to provide the same functionality. Otherwise, consider hard coding both the command
    and arguments to be used, or at the very least restricting which arguments can be passed
    to the command execution function.
