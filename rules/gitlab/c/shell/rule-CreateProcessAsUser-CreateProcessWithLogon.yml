  message: |
    Due to how `CreateProcess` parses spaces, an attacker may be able to exploit this function
    by creating a binary with the same name that is loaded first, depending on the search path
    order.

    Ensure that quotation marks around the executable path are used, such as:
    ```
    CreateProcessAsUser(hToken, NULL, "\"C:\\Program Files\\MyApp.exe\"", ...)
    ```
