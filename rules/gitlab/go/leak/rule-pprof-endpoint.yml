  message: |
    Go has a built in profiling service that is enabled by starting an HTTP server with
    `net/http/pprof` imported. The `/debug/pprof` endpoint does not require any
    authentication and can be accessed by anonymous users. This profiling endpoint
    can leak sensitive information and should not be enabled in production.

    To remediate this, remove the `net/http/pprof` import from the file.
