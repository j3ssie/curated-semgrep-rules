  message: |
    TLS versions 1.1 and 1.0 were deprecated by the IETF in June 2018 due to a number of attacks
    against
    the vulnerable versions. Use of a deprecated TLS version may result in the unauthorized
    retrieval
    of sensitive information. It is strongly recommended that all TLS connections
    use TLS 1.3 as Go will automatically choose the most secure cipher when negotiating the
    TLS handshake with client or servers. TLS 1.3 cipher suites are configured to require Perfect
    Forward Secrecy (PFS).
    PFS is an important property as it will ensure that past encrypted transmissions could not be
    decrypted
    if the TLS certificate was compromised.

    Example using TLS 1.3 for a Go server:
    ```
    cert, err := tls.LoadX509KeyPair("server.crt", "server.key")
    if err != nil {
      log.Fatal(err)
    }

    cfg := &tls.Config{Certificates: []tls.Certificate{cert}, MinVersion: tls.VersionTLS13}
    srv := &http.Server{
      Addr:         ":8999",
      TLSConfig:    cfg,
      ReadTimeout:  time.Minute,
      WriteTimeout: time.Minute,
    }
    log.Fatal(srv.ListenAndServeTLS("", ""))
    ```
