  message: |
    Binding to all network interfaces can potentially open up a service to
    traffic on unintended interfaces, that may not be properly documented or
    secured. By passing "0.0.0.0" as the address to the `Listen` family of functions,
    the application will bind to all interfaces.

    Consider passing in the interface ip address through an environment variable,
    configuration file, or by determining the primary interface(s) IP address.

    Example getting the IP address from an environment variable `IP_ADDRESS`:
    ```
    addr := os.Getenv("IP_ADDRESS")
    listener, err := net.Listen("tcp", addr)
    if err != nil {
      log.Fatal(err)
    }
    ```
