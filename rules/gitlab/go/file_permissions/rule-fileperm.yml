  message: |
    The application was found setting file permissions to overly permissive values. Consider
    using the following values if the application user is the only process to access
    the file:

    - 0400 - read only access to the file
    - 0200 - write only access to the file
    - 0600 - read/write access to the file

    Example creating a file with read/write permissions for the application user:
    ```
    f, err := os.OpenFile("file.txt", os.O_CREATE, 0600)
    if err != nil {
      log.Fatal(err)
    }
    defer f.Close()
    // continue to work with file here
    ```

    For all other values please see:
