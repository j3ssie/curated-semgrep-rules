  message: |
    The application was found setting directory permissions to overly permissive values. Consider
    using the following values if the application user is the only process to access
    files in the directory specified:
    - 0700 - read/write access to the files in the directory

    Another common value is `0750` which allows the application user read/write access and group
    users to read the files contained in the directory.

    Example creating a directory with read/write permissions for only the application user:
    ```
    err := os.Mkdir("directory", 0700)
    if err != nil {
      log.Fatal(err)
    }
    ```

    For all other values please see:
