  message: |
    The application is potentially exposing the entire filesystem by mounting the root
    directory `/` to an HTTP handler function. Anyone who is able to access this HTTP
    server may be able to access any file that the HTTP server has access to.

    Restrict the `http.Dir` path to only a specific folder instead of the entire
    filesystem.

    Example server only allowing directory listing on a public directory:
    ```
    const path = "/var/www/html/public"
    fs := http.FileServer(http.Dir(path))
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":9000", fs))
    ```
