  message: |
    The application was found setting file permissions to overly permissive values. Consider
    using the following values if the application user is the only process to access
    the file:

    - 0400 - read only access to the file
    - 0200 - write only access to the file
    - 0600 - read/write access to the file

    Example writing file contents with read/write permissions for the application user:
    ```
    dat := []byte("sensitive data")
    if err := os.WriteFile("file.txt", dat, 0600); err != nil {
      log.Fatal(err)
    }
    ```

    For all other values please see:
