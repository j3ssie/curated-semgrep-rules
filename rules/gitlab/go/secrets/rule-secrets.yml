  message: |
    A potential hard-coded password was identified. Passwords should not be stored directly in code
    but loaded from secure locations such as a Key Management System (KMS).

    The purpose of using Key Management System's is so access can be audited and keys easily
    rotated
    in the event of a breach. By hardcoding passwords, it will be extremely difficult to determine
    when or if, a key is compromised.

    The recommendation on which KMS to use depends on the environment the application is running
    in:

    - For Google Cloud Platform consider [Cloud Key Management](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs)
    - For Amazon Web Services consider [AWS Key Management](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/)
    - For on premise or other alternatives to cloud providers, consider [Hashicorp's
    Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/)
    - For other cloud providers, please see their documentation
