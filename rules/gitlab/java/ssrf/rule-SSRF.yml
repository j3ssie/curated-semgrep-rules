    Server-Side-Request-Forgery (SSRF) exploits backend systems that initiate requests to third
    parties.
    If user input is used in constructing or sending these requests, an attacker could supply
    malicious
    data to force the request to other systems or modify request data to cause unwanted actions.

    Ensure user input is not used directly in constructing URLs or URIs when initiating requests
    to third party
    systems from back end systems. Care must also be taken when constructing payloads using user
    input. Where
    possible restrict to known URIs or payloads. Consider using a server-side map where keys are
    used to return
    URLs such as `https://site/goto?key=1` where `{key: 1, url: 'http://some.url/', key: 2, url:
    'http://...'}`.

    If you must use user-supplied input for requesting URLs, it is strongly recommended that the
    HTTP client
    chosen allows you to customize and block certain IP ranges at the network level. By blocking
    RFC 1918
    addresses or other network address ranges, you can limit the severity of a successful SSRF
    attack. Care must
    also be taken to block certain protocol or address formatting such as IPv6.

    If you cannot block address ranges at the client level, you may want to run the HTTP client
    as a protected
    user, or in a protected network where you can apply IP Table or firewall rules to block access
    to dangerous
    addresses. Finally, if none of the above protections are available, you could also run a
    custom HTTP proxy
    and force all requests through it to handle blocking dangerous addresses.

    Example using a map to look up a key to be used in a HTTP request:
    ```
    HashMap<String, String> lookupTable = new HashMap<>();
    lookupTable.put("key1", "https://example.com/");
    lookupTable.put("key2", "https://safeurl.com/");
    String userInput = request.getParameter("key");

    // Create a CloseableHttpClient, ideally any requests issued should be done
    // out-of-band from the servlet request itself (such as using a separate thread/scheduler
    system)
    try (final CloseableHttpClient httpClient = HttpClients.createDefault()) {
        // Lookup the value from our user input from our lookupTable
        String value = lookupTable.getOrDefault(userInput, "https://example.com/");
        // Construct the url, with the hardcoded url and only pass in the value from the
    lookupTable,
        // not direct user input
        final HttpGet httpget = new HttpGet(value);
        // Execute the request
        CloseableHttpResponse clientResponse = httpClient.execute(httpget);
        // Read the response
        byte[] responseData = clientResponse.getEntity().getContent().readAllBytes();
        // Handle the response
        // ...
    }
    ```

    If using a map is not possible, the user-supplied input must be encoded prior to use, and
    never allow full
    URLs:
    ```
    // Get user input
    String userInput = request.getParameter("key");
    // Encode the string using java.net.URLEncoder with the UTF-8 character set
    String encodedString = java.net.URLEncoder.encode(userInput, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
    // Create a CloseableHttpClient, ideally any requests issued should be done
    // out-of-band from the servlet request itself (such as using a separate thread/scheduler
    system)
    try (final CloseableHttpClient httpClient = HttpClients.createDefault()) {
      // Construct the url, with the hardcoded url and only pass in the encoded value, never a
    full URL
      final HttpGet httpget = new HttpGet("https://example.com/getId?key="+encodedString);
      // Execute the request
      CloseableHttpResponse clientResponse = httpClient.execute(httpget);
      // Read the response
      byte[] responseData = clientResponse.getEntity().getContent().readAllBytes();
      // handle the response
    }
    ```
