  message: |
    SAML parses attestations as an XML document. By processing XML comments,
    comment fields can end up modifying the interpretation of input fields.
    This could allow an adversary to insert an XML comment to break up the attestation's
    username or other fields, allowing an attacker to bypass authorization or authentication
    checks.

    To remediate this issue, when using `org.opensaml.xml.parse.BasicParserPool` ensure
    `setIgnoreComments(true)` is called.
