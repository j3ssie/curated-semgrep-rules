  message: |
    The application was found using user-supplied input in a `java.sql.Connection`'s
    `setCatalog` call. This could allow an adversary to supply a different database for the
    lifetime of the connection. Allowing external control of system settings can disrupt service
    or cause an application to behave in unexpected, and potentially malicious ways. Most likely
    this would only cause an error by providing a nonexistent catalog name.

    It is recommended to not use user-supplied input when selecting the database for an
    applications
    database connection.
