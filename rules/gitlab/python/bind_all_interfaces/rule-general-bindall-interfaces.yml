  message: |
    Binding to all network interfaces can potentially open up a service to
    traffic on unintended interfaces, that may not be properly documented or
    secured. By passing "0.0.0.0", "::" or an empty string as the address to the `socket.bind`
    function,
    the application will bind to all interfaces.

    Consider passing in the interface ip address through an environment variable,
    configuration file, or by determining the primary interface(s) IP address.

    Example getting the IP address from an environment variable `IP_ADDRESS`:
    ```
    # Get the IP_ADDRESS env variable, or bind to
    # 127.0.0.1 if it is not set
    address = os.getenv("IP_ADDRESS", "127.0.0.1")
    # Create an internet socket
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET)
    # Set the port to listen on
    port = 9777
    # Bind to the address and port combination
    sock.bind((address, port))
    # Listen for connections
    sock.listen()
    # Handle the connection
    ```
