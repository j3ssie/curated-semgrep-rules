    The application was found using a telnet library. As telnet does not provide encryption, it is
    strongly recommended that communications use a more secure transport such as
    SSH.

    The [paramiko](https://www.paramiko.org/) library can be used to initiate SSH connections.

    Example using `paramiko` SSH client:
    ```
    import paramiko
    import scp

    # Create an SSH client
    with paramiko.SSHClient() as ssh:
        # Load the system host keys so we can confirm the
        # host we are connecting to is legitimate
        ssh.load_system_host_keys('/home/appuser/.ssh/known_hosts')

        # Connect to the remote host using our SSH private key
        ssh.connect(hostname='example.org',
                    port=22,
                    username='appuser',
                    key_filename='/home/appuser/.ssh/private_key')
        # Work with the connection
    ```
