  message: |
    The application was found setting file permissions to overly permissive values. Consider
    using the following values if the application user is the only process to access
    the file:

    - 0400 - read only access to the file
    - 0200 - write only access to the file
    - 0600 - read/write access to the file

    Example creating a file with read/write permissions for the application user:
    ```
    # Use octal values to set 0o600 (read/write access to the file) for the current
    # user
    os.chmod('somefile.txt', 0o600)
    ```

    For all other values please see:
