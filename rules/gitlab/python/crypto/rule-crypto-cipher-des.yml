    DES, TripleDES, RC2 and RC4 are all considered broken or insecure cryptographic algorithms.
    Newer algorithms apply message integrity to validate ciphertext has not been tampered
    with. Consider using `ChaCha20Poly1305` instead as it is easier and faster than the
    alternatives such as `AES-256-GCM`.

    For older applications that don't have support for `ChaCha20Poly1305`,
    `AES-256-GCM` is recommended, however it has many drawbacks:
    - Slower than `ChaCha20Poly1305`.
    - Catastrophic failure if nonce values are reused.

    Note that the `Crypto` and `Cryptodome` Python packages are no longer recommended for
    new applications, instead consider using the [cryptography](https://cryptography.io/) package.

    Example using `ChaCha20Poly1305`:
    ```
    import os
    # Import ChaCha20Poly1305 from cryptography
    from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead import ChaCha20Poly1305
    # Our plaintext to encrypt
    plain_text = b"Secret text to encrypt"
    # We do not require authenticated but unencrypted data, so set to None
    aad = None
    # Generate a secure key
    key = ChaCha20Poly1305.generate_key()
    # Create a new ChaCha20Poly1305 instance with our secure key
    chacha = ChaCha20Poly1305(key)
    # Note: nonce values _must_ be regenerated every time they are used.
    nonce = os.urandom(12)
    # Encrypt our plaintext
    cipher_text = chacha.encrypt(nonce, plain_text, aad)
    # Decrypt the plain text using the nonce and cipher_text
    chacha.decrypt(nonce, cipher_text, aad)
    ```

    Example using `AESGCM`:
    ```
    import os
    # Import AESGCM from cryptography
    from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead import AESGCM
    # Our plaintext to encrypt
    plain_text = b"Secret text to encrypt"
    # We do not require authenticated but unencrypted data, so set to None
    aad = None
    # Generate a secure key
    key = AESGCM.generate_key(bit_length=128)
    # Create a new AESGCM instance with our secure key
    aesgcm = AESGCM(key)
    # Note: nonce values _must_ be regenerated every time they are used.
    nonce = os.urandom(12)
    # Encrypt our plaintext
    cipher_text = aesgcm.encrypt(nonce, plain_text, aad)
    # Decrypt the plain text using the nonce and cipher_text
    aesgcm.decrypt(nonce, cipher_text, aad)
    ```
