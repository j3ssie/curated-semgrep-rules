  message: |
    The application was found using the `xml.dom.minidom` package for processing XML. Python's
    default XML processors suffer from various XML parsing vulnerabilities
    and care must be taken when handling XML data. Additionally, depending on the
    version of Python, more critical vulnerabilities such as eXternal XML Entity
    injection maybe exploitable.

    The `xml.dom.minidom` package suffers from the following security risks as of Python 3.7.1:
    * Billion laughs / exponential entity expansion - May allow an adversary to cause
      a Denial of Service (DoS) against the application parsing arbitrary XML.
    * Quadratic blowup entity expansion - Similar to above, but requires a larger input
      to cause the Denial of Service.

    To remediate the above issues, consider using the
    [defusedxml](https://pypi.org/project/defusedxml/)
    library when processing untrusted XML.

    Example parsing an XML document using defusedxml:
    ```
    from defusedxml.ElementTree import parse

    # Parse the inventory.xml file
    et = parse('inventory.xml')
    # Get the root element
    root = et.getroot()
    # Work with the root element
    # ...
    ```
