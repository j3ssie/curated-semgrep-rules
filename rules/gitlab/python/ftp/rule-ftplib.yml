    The application was found using an FTP library. As FTP does not provide encryption, it is
    strongly recommended that any file transfers be done over a more secure transport such as
    SSH.

    The [paramiko](https://www.paramiko.org/) library can be used with an SCP module to allow
    secure file transfers.

    Example using `paramiko` SSH client and the `scp` module:
    ```
    import paramiko
    import scp

    # Create an SSH client
    with paramiko.SSHClient() as ssh:
        # Load the system host keys so we can confirm the
        # host we are connecting to is legitimate
        ssh.load_system_host_keys('/home/appuser/.ssh/known_hosts')

        # Connect to the remote host using our SSH private key
        ssh.connect(hostname='example.org',
                    port=22,
                    username='appuser',
                    key_filename='/home/appuser/.ssh/private_key')

        # Create an SCP client with the ssh transport and copy files
        with scp.SCPClient(ssh.get_transport()) as secure_copy:
            secure_copy.get('remote/test.file', 'local/test.file')
            secure_copy.put('local/some.file', 'remote/some.file')
    ```
