  message: |
    The application was found creating temporary files with the insecure `mktemp` method.
    Depending on how the application uses this temporary file, an attacker may be able to create
    symlinks that point to other files prior to the application creating or writing
    to the target file, leading to unintended files being created or overwritten.

    To remediate this issue consider using `tempfile.TemporaryFile` instead.

    Example using `tempfile.TemporaryFile` to write a file:
    ```
    import tempfile

    # Open a new temporary file using a context manager
    with tempfile.TemporaryFile() as fp:
        # Write some data to the temporary file
        fp.write(b'Some data')
        # Seek back to beginning of file
        fp.seek(0)
        # Read it
        data = fp.read()
    # File is automatically closed/removed once we exit the with context
    ```
