  message: |
    The application was found calling the `logging.config.listen`` function, which provides the
    ability to listen for
    external configuration files over a socket server. This listen socket parses part of the
    configuration and calls
    `eval` on the supplied configuration file. A local user, or an adversary who is able to
    exploit
    a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack to communicate over localhost, would be able to
    execute arbitrary
    code by passing in a logging config that contains python code.

    To remediate the issue, remove the call to `logging.config.listen` method.

    For more information on the listen functionality see:
    - https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.config.html#logging.config.listen
