  message: |
    The application was found calling the `exec` function with a non-literal variable. If the
    variable comes from user-supplied input, an adversary could compromise the entire system by
    executing arbitrary python code.

    To remediate this issue, remove all calls to `exec` and consider alternative methods for
    executing
    the necessary business logic. There is almost no safe method of calling `eval` with
    user-supplied input.

    If the application only needs to convert strings into objects, consider using `json.loads`.
    In some cases `ast.literal_eval` is recommended, but this should be avoided as it can still
    suffer from other issues such as the ability for malicious code to crash the python
    interpreter or application.

    Example using `json.loads`` to load in arbitrary data to create data structures:
    ```
    # User supplied data as a blob of JSON
    user_supplied_data = """{"user": "test", "metadata": [1,2,3]}"""
    # Load the JSON
    user_object = json.loads(user_supplied_data)
    # Manually add protected properties _after_ loading, never before
    user_object["is_admin"] = False
    # Work with the object
    ```
