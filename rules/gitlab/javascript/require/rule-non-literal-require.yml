  message: |
    The application was found to dynamically import a module by calling `require` using a
    non-literal string. An adversary might be able to read the first line of
    arbitrary files. If they had write access to the file system, they may also be able to
    execute arbitrary code.

    To remediate this issue, use a hardcoded string literal when calling `require`. Never call it
    it with dynamically created variables or user-supplied data.
