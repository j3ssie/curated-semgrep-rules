    Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a the text based protocol used for
    email delivery. Like with HTTP, headers are separate by new line separator. If
    kuser input is place in a header line, the application should remove or replace
    new line characters (CR / LF). You should use a safe wrapper such as Apache
    Common Email and Simple Java Mail which filter special characters that can lead
    to header injection.
